# Artificialgeneralintelligence.dev Website Repository

## Overview

Artificialgeneralintelligence.dev is an open-source community website that aims to establish a set of principles and processes for AGI development in the 21st century. We focus on emulating aspects of the human brain through empirical processes in machines, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in AI research.

## How do we build AGI?

Our approach to building AGI involves understanding and replicating the mechanisms of the human brain. We believe that by studying the brain’s functionality and applying these insights to machine intelligence, we can make significant strides in AGI development.

## Software Artifacts

This website serves as a hub for research and development, providing access to the latest state-of-the-art engineering principles and philosophical foundations of AGI. Our software artifacts include:

> Research papers

> Development tools

> Collaborative projects

> Educational resources


## Resources

First, to be an AGI developer, there is a large emphasis on Critical Thinking! Our resources are designed to enhance your understanding of AGI and foster critical analysis skills. Key resources include:

> Educational articles on brain science and AGI

> Tutorials on AGI development

> Forums for discussion and collaboration

## Critical Thinking

What is critical thinking, and why are we talking about this?

Critical thinking involves analyzing and evaluating information to form a well-founded judgment. In the context of AGI, it means questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and considering multiple perspectives. Systems thinking is a key component of critical thinking, as it helps us understand complex relationships and interactions. The brain is a complex system, and without a clear understanding of its mechanisms, we cannot develop AGI effectively.

## Importance in AGI Development

Why is there a lot of emphasis on critical thinking?

Brain science is in its infancy, and our understanding of the brain is constantly evolving. Critical thinking allows us to navigate the uncertainties and complexities of brain science, helping us develop an effective applied philosophy to AGI.

## De-Obfuscation

We aim to de-obfuscate common misunderstandings about the brain and intelligence. The brain is a biological organ, not a computer, and our goal is to develop AGI by understanding its unique properties and mechanisms. There is lots of misinformation about how the brain and computation work, and we aim to clarify these misconceptions.

## Biology and Evolutionary Principles

Understanding the biological and evolutionary principles that govern the brain is crucial for AGI development. Our research focuses on:

> The biological and physical basis of intelligence

> Evolutionary algorithms and their application to AGI

> Comparative studies of human and machine intelligence
